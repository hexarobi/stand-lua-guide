tl;dr Don't get hung up on the details, just jump in and start having fun building something.

# Hello World for Stand Lua

As tradition when learning a new language, your first task should be a
simple script that prints the message "Hello World!".

1. Create a new text file  in `Stand/Lua Scripts`, something like `MyScript.lua`
2. Within this file, add the following text
```lua
menu.my_root():action("My Action", {}, "", function()
    util.toast("Hello World!")
end)
```
3. Save the file
4. Open your Lua Scripts folder in the menu, at `Stand > Lua Scripts`.
   You may need to reload the list to see your new file.
5. Run your script by selecting it in the list and then choosing `Start Script`
6. Once your script is running, it should display your custom action, `My Action`.
   Select `My Action` to trigger the "Hello World!" message on your screen.
7. You did it! ðŸŽ‰ You can add Stand Lua Scripter to your resume!

# What is the Hello World script doing?

1. `menu.my_root()` returns a reference to your scripts menu root, which can then be used for adding new menu options to.
2. Using the reference to our scripts root menu, we can call it's `action()` function to create a new action menu item.
3. The `action()` function accepts several parameters
- Name. The name of the option in the menu.
- Commands List. Commands are used by the command box or chat to trigger commands.
- Help. The description help text that displays when this option is selected.
- Handler. The function that executed when this action is triggered.
4. Within the action handler, we display a message to the screen using the `util.toast()` function.

# Where to go from here?

You probably have some idea in your head for a feature you want to add to Stand,
but how do you build it? Start small and take it step-by-step.
Spend some time reading through the docs and other Lua Scripts and see how they work.
If you get stuck the Stand discord #programming channel might be helpful, 
but don't expect to be spoonfed answers.
